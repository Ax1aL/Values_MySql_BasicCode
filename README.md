# Values_MySql_BasicCode
It's a simple program creating a template for inserting rows in columns for MySql.
It's for easier completing and testing some tables(that was the point) instead of copy pasting.
This program was not optimized or thought through,I just worte what came to mind in that moment.
Could have made it easier but this is a first draft.
